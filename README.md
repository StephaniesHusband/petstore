# BDD Testing Exercise

This was developed from an example given to us from Dave Haws (our Agile Guru). I have converted his example to use
[Cucumber](cucumber.io) and [Cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js).

You will need to clone the repo and then run `npm install` to pick up cucumber js.  You will also need to install Cucumber.
I suggest globally via `npm install -g cucumber`.

When you are ready run `.\node_modules\.bin\cucumber-js` to run your tests.
